Online Food Delivery System Using Vb.Net


The Online Food Delivery System, built using VB.Net in Visual Studio, is a comprehensive web application that enables users to order food from a wide range of restaurants conveniently. This system provides a user-friendly interface for customers to browse restaurant menus, select items, customize orders, and make payments securely.

Created in Visual Studio 2012

To connect a DataBase I have used MS Access and saved the databse as a .mdb file (2002-2003 version)
